Based on the information provided, it seems like the food you're describing is a cheeseburger with various toppings. Here are some considerations for its healthiness:

1. **Calories:**
   - 903.23 calories is quite high for a single meal, and regular consumption of such calorie-dense foods can contribute to weight gain if not balanced with an overall healthy diet and physical activity.

2. **Ingredients:**
   - The sesame seed bun, ground beef patty, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and grilled onions provide a mix of essential nutrients like protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
   - However, ingredients like butter, mayonnaise, and ketchup can add extra saturated fats, sugars, and calories, potentially compromising the overall healthfulness of the meal.

3. **Sodium and Fat Content:**
   - Ground beef and cheese can be significant sources of saturated fat and sodium, which can be harmful in excess and contribute to heart disease and high blood pressure.
  
4. **Micro Nutrients:**
   - Without specific details on the micro-nutrient content, it is difficult to evaluate the overall nutritional value of the cheeseburger. Micro-nutrients like vitamins and minerals are essential for various bodily functions, so it's important to have a diverse diet to ensure you're getting all the necessary nutrients.

In moderation, a cheeseburger can fit into a balanced diet, but it's essential to pair it with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to ensure you're meeting all your nutritional needs. Enjoying this cheeseburger as an occasional treat rather than a regular indulgence may be a more health-conscious choice.
